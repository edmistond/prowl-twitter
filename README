prowl-twitter 0.1

Hack this up however you like, a good chunk of it is off
blogs, specifically John Mettraux's at
http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/2008/11/04/ruby-twitter-growl/

It's pretty straightforward. You need most of the gems
installed as described in John's post, plus the prowl gem.
Then just drop your Twitter u/p and your Prowl API key into
the file and run it.

To-do: * Re-enable https connection to Twitter
